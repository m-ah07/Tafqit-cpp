# Tafqit-C++

Tafqit-C++ is a practical solution designed to convert numbers into words, tailored for C++ developers. Currently supporting English, this project simplifies the process of integrating number-to-words functionality into applications. Its modular design ensures that developers can easily extend the service to support additional languages, making it versatile and adaptable to various localization needs.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to implement efficient and customizable number-to-words conversion in their C++ applications.

## Features
- Convert numbers to words in English.
- Modular design for adding support for other languages.
- Simple and clean implementation using C++.

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use the Tafqit service in your C++ project:

   ```
      #include "src/tafqit.h"
      #include <iostream>
      
      int main() {
          int number = 123;
          std::string result = numberToWords(number, "en");
          std::cout << "Number in words: " << result << std::endl;
          return 0;
      }
   ```

This example demonstrates a basic usage of the Tafqit service to convert a number into words. You can extend it further by integrating it with your application or adding support for more languages.
